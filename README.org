* Dateify

The =dateify= command will add a prefix of the form "YYYYMMDDHHmmss--" to a file's name, based on its creation date. =dateify --undo= will remove that prefix.

Requirements. Depends on `stat` and `date`. Detects if it finds the coreutuils or BSD version, so it will work on Linux, on macOS, or in macOS environments where the PATH points to coreutils versions.
