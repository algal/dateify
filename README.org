* Dateify

The =dateify= command will add a prefix of the form "YYYYMMDDHHmmss--" to a file's name, based on its creation date. =dateify --undo= will remove that prefix.

Why this format? It is precise enough usually to be unique for manually created files, so it serves as a decent short ID. It sorts into time order. It has no spaces, so it is easier to handle safely in filenames. It's a valid ISO8601 variation. For these reasons, it is is also the timestamp format defined by [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d][the Denote note-taking system in emacs]]. 

** Requirements. 

The python version needs Python 3.6 or later.

The bash version of the command depends on `stat` and `date`. It detects if it finds the coreutuils or BSD version, so it will work on Linux, on macOS, or in macOS environments where the PATH points to coreutils versions.
